* A map of the island is key in showing the beaches, resorts and activities.

* Show them our favourite locations so we may monetize this also 

### Design
##### *Color Scheme*
* The colors repeated throughout the site are:

  1. Black #fff
  2. Linear Color #ff0844 down to #ffb199
  3. #ff8177 was used on the Newsletter Button
  4. Text is in white and Black
  5. Yellow is also used for the opening text message and on the attractions buttons so they stand out more.

##### *Typography*
* Kumbh Sans is the font used throughout the site with Sans Serif as the fallback font on the occasion the sites other fonts aren't loading properly.

##### *Imagery*
* The page opens with a video of the Island of Tenerife. This was taken from youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMn6f__BLw 
* There are also 3 images that load when any of the buttons are clicked. These were taken from either the venues website, tripadvisor, expedia and google. 


##### *Homepage* 
* All pages were designed for ease of use with a simple column and row design. Landing pages on mobile have moved the navigation menu under the logo image.
![menu under logo](/assets/readmeimages/logomenu.PNG "logo with menu underneath")

* All devices contain a call to action button, encouraging users to get in contact about special offers.

![call to action button](/assets/readmeimages/actionbutton.PNG "call to action button")

* As you scroll down the homepage you will come across the packages that are available to couples for their wedding.

![packages available](/assets/readmeimages/packages.PNG "packages available on homepage")

* In the footer I have placed our logo linking back to our homepage, a contact number and email along with social icons that link to the platforms.

![footer](/assets/readmeimages/footer.PNG "image of the footer")


##### *Gallery & Reviews Page*
* The Gallery & Reviews page has all images and reviews organized neatly in three columns, and 3 rows.
  When viewed on moblie devices this becomes 1 column with all images and reviews in rows underneath. 

* There is a promotional video located near the top of the page embeded from youtube.

* Images can be clicked to open in a larger size on a different browser tab.

* Again I have placed the call to action button under the hero image for continuity and ease. 

##### *Contact Page*
* A form has been created here for couples to make inquiries.
![form on contact page](/assets/readmeimages/form.PNG "form on contact page")

* The form gathers basic information such as name and email but most importantly the date of the couples wedding.

* There is also a text-area for any further information or questions that they may have.

   * Google fonts were used to import the "Kumbh Sans" into the style.css file which is used throughout the project.

   * Font Awesome was used throughout the website to add icons for UX purposes. They appear on all footers and also on the contact form and newsletter form.

   * Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit and push to Github.

***

## **Testing**
* The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the website. This ensured there were no syntax errors.

* CSS Validation can be seen here:<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/cssvalidation.PNG" width="400px" height="400px"> 

* The first time I ran the the css validator it returned an error in which I had forgotten the seconds on a transition.
    This was quickly rectified

* HTML5 Validation for the index page can be see here:<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/htmlvalidation.PNG" width="400px" height="400px">
* The first time I ran the the html validator it returned an error in which "type=text/JavaScript" was no longer needed so I deleted this.


### Testing User Stories from UX Section
**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a first time user, I would like to easily understand what Tenerife offer. Is there much to do and see?
   * Upon entering, users are greeted with an eye-grabbing hero drone video of the island of Tenerife.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/homepage.PNG" width="600px" height="400px">
<br>

   * Users are also greeted with a welcome message to get them excited about their holiday.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/welcome.PNG" width="600px" height="200px">
   
2. As a first time user, it is very important to be able to easily navigate through the site. 

   * When arriving at the site, the user has several options. In the top right corner of the page is the menu which navigates through the site.
     The colour of the text is white and the background black so it really stands out to them.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/navbar.PNG" width="400px" height="75px">
   
   * As you'll see there is a highlighted button on the navbar for Newsletter. It's imperative we get people to sign up to our Newsletter for monetizing the website.  
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/newsletter.PNG" width="200px" height="75px"><br>

   * As Users scroll down the page, they see a welcome message and a little info about Tenerife and what this website is going to focus on.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/websiteinfo.PNG" width="600px" height="300px">

   * There is also a link here to take them directly to the Newsletter Sign up page. 

3. As a first time user, I would like to check out the djs social pages.

   * On the fotter there are links to each of my business social pages which users can check out. These contain more videos and more up to date information<br>
   ![footer social](/assets/readmeimages/social.PNG "social icons on footer")


**Returning Visitors**

1. As a returning visitor, I would like to see up to date pictures and reviews.
   * The images in the gallery can be easily updated and up to date reviews added. 

**Frequent Visitors**

* As weddings are one off events I don't foresee visitors returning.

### Further Testing

* The website was tested on Google Chrome with dev tools and also Firefox browsers.
* I also used the Unicorn Revealer extension to check errors with columns.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & Samsung mobile devices.
* There was an issue with the cover text on the hero image being in the wrong place, it was relative to the page. I changed this to be relative to the hero image and it works perfectly. 
* All the links on every page were tested on all browsers to ensure they are working properly.
* My family members were recruited to play on the site and inform me of any changes they felt needed to be made, look for mistakes and check all links worked as they should.

***

## **Deployment**

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the repository, locate the "settings" button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" and click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### What I would like to impliment going forward

* To move this project forward I would like google maps to populate the map with markers automatically. As venues open or close this would populate according to google maps. 
* I would run a google ad campaign to raise awareness of this website. 
* It would be great to partner with hotels/theme parks/restaurants etc. to create advertising for them to be included in our social media and Newsletter.
