* A map of the island is key in showing the beaches, resorts and activities.

* Show them our favourite locations so we may monetize this also 

### Design

  1. Black #fff
  2. Linear Color #ff0844 down to #ffb199
  3. #ff8177 was used on the Newsletter Button
  4. Text is in white and Black
  5. Yellow is also used for the opening text message and on the attractions buttons so they stand out more.

##### *Typography*
* Kumbh Sans is the font used throughout the site with Sans Serif as the fallback font on the occasion the sites other fonts aren't loading properly.

##### *Imagery*
* The page opens with a video of the Island of Tenerife. This was taken from youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQMn6f__BLw 
* There are also 3 images that load when any of the buttons are clicked. These were taken from either the venues website, tripadvisor, expedia and google. 


##### *Homepage* 
* All pages were designed for ease of use with a simple column and row design. Landing pages on mobile have moved the navigation menu under the logo image.
![menu under logo](/assets/readmeimages/logomenu.PNG "logo with menu underneath")

* All devices contain a call to action button, encouraging users to get in contact about special offers.

![call to action button](/assets/readmeimages/actionbutton.PNG "call to action button")

* As you scroll down the homepage you will come across the packages that are available to couples for their wedding.

![packages available](/assets/readmeimages/packages.PNG "packages available on homepage")

* In the footer I have placed our logo linking back to our homepage, a contact number and email along with social icons that link to the platforms.

##### *Gallery & Reviews Page*
* The Gallery & Reviews page has all images and reviews organized neatly in three columns, and 3 rows.
  When viewed on moblie devices this becomes 1 column with all images and reviews in rows underneath. 

* There is a promotional video located near the top of the page embeded from youtube.

* Images can be clicked to open in a larger size on a different browser tab.

* Again I have placed the call to action button under the hero image for continuity and ease. 

##### *Contact Page*
* A form has been created here for couples to make inquiries.
![form on contact page](/assets/readmeimages/form.PNG "form on contact page")

* The form gathers basic information such as name and email but most importantly the date of the couples wedding.

* There is also a text-area for any further information or questions that they may have.

### Testing User Stories from UX Section
**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a first time user, I would like to easily understand what this dj offers.
   * Upon entering, users are greeted with an eye-grabbing hero image of a couple kissing on a dancefloor, whith smiling guests around them.

   * On desktop devices there is also a container over the hero image with a tagline.
   ![tagline](/assets/readmeimages/taglineimage.PNG "tagline over main image")
   
2. As a first time user, I would like to easily navigate through the site's content.

   * When arriving at the site, the user has several options. In the top right corner of the page is the menu which navigates through the site.
     The colour of the text is white and the background purple indicating which page they are on.<br>
     ![homepage highlighted](/assets/readmeimages/menulist.PNG "landing page button styled to show which page you are on")<br>
     ![gallery highlighted](/assets/readmeimages/menupage.PNG "landing page gallery button styled to show which page you are on") 
   
   * Under the hero image is a strategically placed call to action button, encouraging couples to get in touch about discounts for midweek weddings. 

   * As Users scroll down the page, they see a welcome message and a little info about Limerick DJ.
   ![welcome message](/assets/readmeimages/welcomemessage.PNG "welcome message on homepage")

   * There is also a link here to take them directly to the Gallery & Reviews page. 

3. As a first time user, I would like to check out the djs social pages.

   * On the fotter there are links to each of my business social pages which users can check out. These contain more videos and more up to date information<br>
   ![footer social](/assets/readmeimages/social.PNG "social icons on footer")


**Returning Visitors**

1. As a returning visitor, I would like to see up to date pictures and reviews.
   * The images in the gallery can be easily updated and up to date reviews added. 

**Frequent Visitors**

* As weddings are one off events I don't foresee visitors returning.

### Further Testing

* The website was tested on Google Chrome with dev tools and also Firefox browsers.
* I also used the Unicorn Revealer extension to check errors with columns.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & Samsung mobile devices.
* There was an issue with the cover text on the hero image being in the wrong place, it was relative to the page. I changed this to be relative to the hero image and it works perfectly. 
* All the links on every page were tested on all browsers to ensure they are working properly.
* My family members were recruited to play on the site and inform me of any changes they felt needed to be made, look for mistakes and check all links worked as they should.

***

## **Deployment**

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the repository, locate the "settings" button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" and click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### What I would like to impliment going forward

* To move this project forward I would like google maps to populate the map with markers automatically. As venues open or close this would populate according to google maps. 
* I would run a google ad campaign to raise awareness of this website. 
* It would be great to partner with hotels/theme parks/restaurants etc. to create advertising for them to be included in our social media and Newsletter.
