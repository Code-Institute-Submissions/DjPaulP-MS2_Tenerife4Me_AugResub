***

## **Testing**
* The W3C Markup Validator, W3C CSS Validator and JShint Services were used to validate the website. This ensured there were no syntax errors.

* CSS Validation can be seen here:<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/cssvalidation.PNG" width="400px" height="400px"> 

* The first time I ran the the css validator it returned an error in which I had forgotten the seconds on a transition.
    This was quickly rectified

* HTML5 Validation for the index page can be see here:<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/htmlvalidation.PNG" width="400px" height="400px">
* The first time I ran the the html validator it returned an error in which "type=text/JavaScript" was no longer needed so I deleted this.

* JSHint Screen shots 
*For maps.js<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/maps_js.PNG" width="400px" height="400px">
* All the warnings listed were the exact same relating to version control which had no impact on the running of the site. 

*For site.js<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/site_js.PNG" width="400px" height="400px">
* Again the warnings listed were all the exact same relating to version control which had no impact on the running of the site.
Everything worked as intended

*For email.js<br>
*Everything working as should be<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/email_js.PNG" width="400px" height="400px">


**Testing elements on the site**<br>
*Navbar<br>
The navbar appears at the top of the page and should reduce in size when the screen is smaller.
It works as intended with the menu reduced to hamburger bars.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/nav_test.PNG" width="400px" height="150px">

*Newsletter
Expected to be able to input name and email. 
Result:<br>
Worked as intended and diplayed errors if email was incorrect format.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/news_test.PNG" width="600px" height="300px">

*Contact Form
Expected to be able to input name, email and message. 
Result:<br>
Worked as intended and diplayed errors if name or email was incorrect format.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/contact_test.PNG" width="600px" height="300px">

*Buttons
The buttons on the side when clicked should populate the location on the map when clicked. 
This worked perfectly as intended<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/buttons_test.PNG" width="400px" height="200px"><br>

Also once a button is clicked is should display the top 3 items for that buttons
For expample when restaurants is clicked is should populate the restaurants on the map and also
list the top 3 restaurants. 
Result:
Worked perfectly as inteded<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/buttons2_test.PNG" width="400px" height="200px">

### Testing User Stories from UX Section
**First Time Visitor Goals**
1. As a first time user, I would like to easily understand what Tenerife offer. Is there much to do and see?
   * Upon entering, users are greeted with an eye-grabbing hero drone video of the island of Tenerife.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/homepage.PNG" width="600px" height="400px">
<br>

   * Users are also greeted with a welcome message to get them excited about their holiday.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/welcome.PNG" width="600px" height="200px">
   
2. As a first time user, it is very important to be able to easily navigate through the site. 

   * When arriving at the site, the user has several options. In the top right corner of the page is the menu which navigates through the site.
     The colour of the text is white and the background black so it really stands out to them.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/navbar.PNG" width="400px" height="75px">
   
   * As you'll see there is a highlighted button on the navbar for Newsletter. It's imperative we get people to sign up to our Newsletter for monetizing the website.  
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/newsletter.PNG" width="200px" height="75px"><br>

   * As Users scroll down the page, they see a welcome message and a little info about Tenerife and what this website is going to focus on.<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/websiteinfo.PNG" width="600px" height="300px">

   * There is also a link here to take them directly to the Newsletter Sign up page. 

3. As a first time user, I would like to check out the djs social pages.

   * On the fotter there are links to each of my business social pages which users can check out. These contain more videos and more up to date information<br>
<img src="/assets/readmeimages/footer.PNG" width="600px" height="300px">



## DevTools

* It tested for the responsiveness of the site across multiple screen resolutions.
    * It revealed an issue with the navbar. When the screen resolution was smaller, the screen would scroll to the right. I made the navbar smaller to rectify this. 
    * When scrolling the screen, the back to top button appeared on the bottom left. When clicked this would bring you back without a nice scroll. This was rectified in [css](https://css-tricks.com/need-to-scroll-to-the-top-of-the-page/)
    * The Bootstrap grid system was updated and implemented more often to control how the columns responded.
    * When the website is inspected using the dev tools, using for example an iphone 5, there's an overflow. If you change to an iphone 8, this disappears and also when you
      change back to an iphone 5 again, it's resolved.

* Debugging
    * Highlighted incorrect use of styling and/or Bootstrap.
    * Console.log was used and placed amoungst the code to debug any issues.


**Returning Visitors**

1. As a returning visitor, I would like to see up to date activities, hotels, bars and restaurants etc. 
   * New activities and venues can very easily be added or taken away.  

**Frequent Visitors**

* As a frequent visitor I would like to see what are the latest offers.
    * By signing up to the newsletter you will recieve all the latest offers and also any updates that have been made on the website. 

### Further Testing

* The website was tested on Google Chrome with dev tools and also Firefox browsers.
* I also used the Unicorn Revealer extension to check errors with columns.
* The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad & Samsung mobile devices.
* I needed to correct the zoom level also for smaller devices. It was zoomed out too far, but also has been rectified.
* There was an issue overflow when the screen size was made smaller there was an overflow. This was corrected by changing the size of the navbar. 
* All the links on every page were tested on all browsers to ensure they are working properly.
* My family members were recruited to play on the site and inform me of any changes they felt needed to be made, look for mistakes and check all links worked as they should.

***

## **Deployment**
* This website was developed in Gitpod and pushed to the remote repository on Github.

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository.
2. At the top of the repository, locate the "settings" button on the menu.
3. Scroll down the settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" and click save.
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site link in the "GitHub Pages" section.
7. The ribbon notification displays this message:  'Your site is published at https://djpaulp.github.io/MS2_Tenerife4Me/'
8. I have provided this link at the top of the README file.

#### Running Project Locally 

To run your own version of this project, it can be cloned or downloaded from Github by following these steps:

* Select the repository from the Github dashboard.
* Click on the green 'Code' button, and click the 'clipboard icon' to copy the URL. It may also be displayed as a 'Clone or Download' green button.
* Open the terminal window of your desired local IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
* Choose the working directory to the location you would like to have the cloned repository.
* Type 'git clone' in the terminal window, and then paste the URL you copied.
* Press enter and the clone will be created.

### What I would like to impliment going forward

* To move this project forward I would like google maps to populate the map with markers automatically. As venues open or close this would populate according to google maps. 
This wasn't implimented due to time constraints. I have started doing this with the map.html file and also the hungry.js file to map restaurants at first.
* I would run a google ad campaign to raise awareness of this website. 
* It would be great to partner with hotels/theme parks/restaurants etc. to create advertising for them to be included in our social media and Newsletter.
